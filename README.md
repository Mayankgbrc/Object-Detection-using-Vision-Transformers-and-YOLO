Note
----

All code files are currently under review and will be uploaded soon as a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file for easier accessibility and experimentation.

Project Overview
----------------

This project showcases object detection models implemented using Vision Transformers and YOLO architectures. Each implementation demonstrates how to process datasets, train models, and visualize detection results.
